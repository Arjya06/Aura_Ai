**Problem Statement**

Current anomaly detection systems rely on rigid rules and static thresholds, leading to false positives, missed threats, and poor explainability. They fail to capture subtle behavioral and contextual cues—such as a legitimate user under stress or an intruder mimicking credentials.

Aura-AI solves this by introducing an emotion and context-aware anomaly detection system that analyzes digital body language (typing, mouse behavior) alongside contextual risk factors (time, location, network). It fuses these insights into a holistic anomaly score and empowers analysts with an AI Co-Pilot for real-time, explainable investigations—making security monitoring more accurate, intelligent, and human-friendly.

🔎 The Problem

Traditional security systems are stuck in the past. They rely on rigid, rule-based logic like “block login after 3 failed attempts.”
That’s not how attackers operate anymore. Today’s threats are subtle—an intruder can steal credentials, behave “normally,” and slip past unnoticed.

What these systems don’t understand is:

A stressed employee under duress doesn’t behave the same as usual.

An intruder might type with different rhythm, hesitation, or mouse speed.

Context matters—erratic typing at 3 AM from an unknown location is way riskier than the same behavior at 2 PM in the office.

Result? ❌ Too many false alarms, ❌ missed threats, and ❌ wasted analyst time.

💡 Our Approach

Aura-AI reimagines anomaly detection by shifting from rules → to behavior + context + AI collaboration.

✨ What makes us unique:

Behavioral Biometrics – We study how a user interacts: typing rhythm, error rate, mouse paths. This is their digital body language.

Contextual Awareness – Time, location, network conditions all factor into risk. We fuse them with behavior for a holistic anomaly score.

AI-Powered Co-Pilot – Instead of raw data dumps, Aura-AI triggers an AI assistant (Gemini) that explains why something is suspicious and guides analysts through real-time, natural language investigations.

⚙️ Technical Magic

Frontend: React + TypeScript for speed and safety.

UI/UX: TailwindCSS for sleek, responsive design.

AI Integration: Google Gemini API powers the AI Co-Pilot.

Visualization: Custom SVG gauges, plots, and charts for full control.

Error Handling: Global error boundaries + descriptive messages → no more blank white screens.

🖥️ User Experience

Start in Simulation Mode → watch anomalies emerge in real-time.

Switch to Live Capture → see your own typing & mouse movements analyzed instantly.

Trigger an Alert → Fused Anomaly Score > 70% pauses the dashboard.

AI Co-Pilot Appears → get an instant, human-readable threat summary.

Investigate in Plain English → ask:

“Which feature was most anomalous?”

“Is this consistent with rushed behavior?”

“Summarize last 5 location risks.”

📌 Project Overview

Aura-AI is more than just a dashboard—it’s a demonstration of the future of security monitoring. By combining behavioral biometrics, contextual intelligence, and AI-driven explainability, it creates a powerful system that is both intelligent and human-friendly. It shows how AI can move security from static rules to adaptive, context-aware defense—where threats are caught not just by what users do, but how and why they do it. In a world where cyberattacks are growing smarter, Aura-AI represents a critical step forward in building trustworthy, proactive, and explainable security solutions.
